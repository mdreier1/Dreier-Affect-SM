# Dreier-PosAffect-SM

+ This code cleans the Rutgers Hamilton Lab SMASH study data to collapse oberservations onto the day-level.
+ Next, I run descriptive statistics on the 19 participants in the sample
+ For my ABCT 2022 poster, I run multilevel models assessing whether social media checking and time spent on social media during the day predict evening negative mood. 
+ For my ABCT 2022 symposium talk, I run multilevel models to assess whether positive and negative affect while on social media predict 1) time spent on social media and 2) social media checking.
+ All above models are looking for within-person effects at the day-level, so I control for between-person effects and day within the study.
+ For the symposium models, I explored associations at the next-day level (e.g., positive affect on day 1 predicting social media behaviors on day 2 and vise versa).
